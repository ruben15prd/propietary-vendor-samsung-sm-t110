 *  Changes between 2.2 and 2.1:
 *
 *  - a small bugfix in the Push opcodes
 *
 *  Changes between 2.1 and 2.0:
 *
 *  - created the TTExec component to take care of all execution
 *    context management.  The interpreter has now one single
 *    function.
 *
 *  - made some changes to support re-entrancy.  The re-entrant
 *    interpreter is smaller!
