This is GNU Ghostscript version 8.64.0.

GNU Ghostscript is an interpreter for the Postscript language and the
Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF), a set of C procedures (the
Ghostscript lib) that implements the graphics capabilities that appear
as primitive operations in the Postscript language and in PDF, and a
set of utility programs that include the ability to convert PostScript
to PDF.

GNU Ghostscript is based on the GPLed Ghostscript made by Ralph Giles,
artofcode LLC and Artifex Software, Inc.  Thanks to Ralph's hard work
for making this release of Ghostscript possible. Also thanks to Andy
Tai from the GNU project for the hard work on GNU Ghostscript versions
before 8.16.
