Websites across the world are increasing their use of the Portable Network
Graphics imaging format, as a powerful and cross-platform way to represent
images. With key features such as alpha blending, it is no surprise that many
websites in countries such as China and India also use larger high-resolution
PNG images on their sites. Increasingly these images are decoded by the mobile
device, and typically also scaled down to fit the user's zoom selection on the
device's browser.

In order to improve the decode time, Qualcomm Innovation Center has optimized
the PNG library found on many common OS platforms such as Web OS, Android, and
Chrome OS. Our team re-implemented the png_read_filter_row() routine to utilize
the DSP-like SIMD capabilities of the ARM NEON instruction set. It was then
tuned for the specific VeNum hardware unit found as part of the CPU subsystem
of the Qualcomm Snapdragon platform.

This resulted in a range of 0-50% improvement in PNG decode times.
